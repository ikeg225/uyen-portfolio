                            <p>Flower is a branding project inspired by the many podcasts I listen to at 1am to wind me down from a tiring/stressful day. Varying from mental health to career growth, Flower serves as a supporter for the most overwhelming parts of your life (which to be honest, is all the time).</p>

                                <p>These illustrations are paired with some of my favorite quotes to help bring good thoughts to days that may seemingly feel dark.</p>

                            <p>Since Flower was my first ever design project for a design class - fun fact, now Iâ€™m a lead faciliator (what a full circle moment) - I knew I wanted to come back to it once I had more time + when my skills are a little more polished. So last summer, I sat down and tweaked stuff here and there to make sure it was up to date with the designer I am today.</p>
                            <p>but here's a glimpse of the old Flower!</p>

                            <h3>Reflection</h3>
                            <p>Just like the values of the podcast, Flower bloomed along with my own growth as a designer. This project will forever hold a special place in my heart as it reminds me of where I started my design journey. Before this project, I felt more lost than ever with the direction I wanted to take with my life. However, Flower sparked back the creativity inside of me that ceased a long time ago. Wherever I go along my creative journey, Flower will be the root that holds me and my dreams together.</p>
